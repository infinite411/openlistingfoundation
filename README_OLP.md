# Open Listing Platform (OLP) - Tools & Standards

An Open, Transparent, and Fair Real Estate Technology Project  
Maintained by the Open Listing Foundation

## Project Overview

The Open Listing Platform (OLP) is an open initiative to create tools, standards, and resources that promote fair, transparent, and accessible real estate markets.

Our goal is to empower consumers, real estate professionals, developers, and organizations with decentralized tools and open standards, eliminating barriers, monopolies, and proprietary lock-ins that dominate the property data landscape today.

## Project Mission

- Build free, open-source tools that support property listing, discovery, and verification.  
- Promote the adoption of the Universal Property Identifier (UPI) â€” a globally unique, persistent property ID standard.  
- Foster collaboration between consumers, developers, advocates, and industry leaders.  
- Reduce reliance on closed, paywalled MLS systems and fragmented databases.  
- Create an ecosystem that is decentralization-ready, interoperable, and accessible worldwide.  

## Key Components

- UPI Standard  
  Globally unique property identifier for accurate tracking and data exchange.

- OLP Tools  
  Practical, ready-to-use software for listing management, property verification, and data integration.

- Open Listing Foundation
